## **:information_source: About :information_source:**

This is a software module developed to answer questions about linear business processes using sophisticated [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) techniques.

This module represents a final thesis written in the form of a program project for the [Faculty of Informatics in Pula](https://fipu.unipu.hr/) under the mentorship of [Nikola TankoviÄ‡](https://www.tankovic.me/). The topic is based on the [program engineering](https://ntankovic.unipu.hr/pi) course.

It was developed using [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) running [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/) notebook. It uses different [HuggingFace models](https://huggingface.co/models), frameworks like [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and datasets like
